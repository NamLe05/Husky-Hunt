# Human Need
University students face a fundamental challenge in developing a meaningful connection to their campus environment. Research consistently shows that students who feel connected to their physical campus environment demonstrate higher levels of academic engagement, social integration, and overall well-being. At large universities like the University of Washington, many students report feeling overwhelmed by the campus size and struggle to venture beyond their familiar academic buildings and dormitories. A 2023 study by the National Survey of Student Engagement found that 68% of students at large public universities never explore areas of campus outside their immediate academic needs, leading to missed opportunities for discovery, social connection, and a sense of belonging. Traditional campus orientation programs address this need superficially through brief tours, but fail to provide ongoing motivation for exploration. Students need an engaging, self-directed way to discover hidden gems, learn campus history, and build familiarity with their environment at their own pace. This lack of campus connection particularly affects commuter students, transfer students, and those with busy schedules who may spend years at a university without truly knowing their surroundings. Husky Hunt addresses this documented need by gamifying campus exploration, providing students with a fun, social, and flexible way to build their connection to the University of Washington through interactive discovery experiences that can fit into their existing schedules and social patterns.
