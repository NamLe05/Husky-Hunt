# Usability and Utility
We used SUS testing on 10 volunteers with varying degrees of tech savvyness. Here are the results:

## Interpretation

- **Overall SUS Score: 66.25%**
- **Learnability: 73.75%**
- **Usability: 64.69%**

The system shows stronger performance in learnability compared to general usability, indicating that while users can learn to use the system, there may be friction in regular usage.

This indicates that users find the app easy to learn through our simple UI layout, but face issues when using it day-to-day, such as the projectâ€™s dependence on good weather, as well as the unreliability of the GPS sensor and lingering issues navigating through campus due to unfamiliarity, despite GPS location points of reference.
